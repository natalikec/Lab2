## Map showing Toronto's Heat Relief Network and Green Spaces 

### Context 
The urban heat island effect occurs in dense urban environments which are filled with paved surfaces and closely packed buildings, resulting in heat being trapped more efficiently. In cities like Toronto, providing spaces for the population to cool down, such as airconditioned spaces or shaded vegetation areas, is vital as prolonged exposure to excessive heat can have negative effects on one's health

### Content 
Map with green polygon features showing green spaces and blue point features showing heat relief facilities 
The map displaces a pop-up when a point feature is clicked, showing the type of facility available 
THe navigation bar includes links to Toronto's heat Relief Strategy and Climate Atlas of Canada's Urban Heat Island information page.
